Oregon Trail on JS-DOS
## The Oregon Trail in the Browser

This project demonstrates how to use [js-dos](https://js-dos.com/) and DOSBox to load a custom bundle containing the classic game **The Oregon Trail** directly in a web browser.

### How It Works
- **js-dos** is a JavaScript port of DOSBox, allowing DOS games to run in modern browsers.
- The game bundle (`bundle.jsdos`) is loaded and emulated entirely in the browser.
- **Save data** is stored using the browser's local storage, so your progress is preserved between sessions.

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to teach how historical games can be saved, preserved, and provided for educational purposes. By making classic games accessible in the browser, we help ensure their continued availability for future generations.

### Legal Notice
All copyrights for The Oregon Trail and related assets remain with their original holders. This project uses the software under the fair use exemption for educational and preservation purposes only.
