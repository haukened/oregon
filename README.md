Oregon Trail on JS-DOS

## What is this repo?

This repo is intended to be an educational primer and how-to for retro gaming on web.  It describes the steps necessary to set up web based emulation for MS-DOS retro games.

While we use The Orgeon Trail as an example, this methodology can be applied to any retro game that you own, and hosted on a web server for you and your family to preserve those games, and their experience, for years to come.

## The Oregon Trail in the Browser

This project demonstrates how to use [js-dos](https://js-dos.com/) and DOSBox to load a custom bundle containing the classic game **The Oregon Trail** directly in a web browser.

### How It Works
- **js-dos** is a JavaScript port of DOSBox, allowing DOS games to run in modern browsers.
- The game bundle (`bundle.jsdos`) is loaded and emulated entirely in the browser.
- **Save data** is stored using the browser's local storage, so your progress is preserved between sessions.

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to teach how historical games can be saved, preserved, and provided for educational purposes. By making classic games accessible in the browser, we help ensure their continued availability for future generations.
